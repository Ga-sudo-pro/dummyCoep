           <p class="h5 my-para">COEP's precursor, The Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School was opened in July 1854, with an aim to provide suitable learning to the subordinate officers in the Public Works Department. The School was situated in Bhawani Peth, Poona , and the accommodation consisted of three small detached houses for teaching purposes and a separate house for the Principal.
            In June 1865 Mr. Theodore Cooke, M.A , who held that appointment for 28 years was appointed Principal. The foundation stone of the new college was laid by His Excellency the Governor, Sir Bartle Frere, on the 5th August 1865.            
            In 1868 the College moved to the New Buildings. The college was divided into three departments for matriculated and unmatriculated students.            
            In 1879 two new classes, an Agricultural class and a Forest class , were added to the college , and the name of the college was changed from " The Poona Civil Engineering College " to " The College of Science". The school became "Poona Civil Engineering College", and subsequently in the year 1911, the nomenclature was changed to the "College of Engineering, Poona". It was initially affiliated 
            to the University of Bombay for a degree of Licentiate in Civil Engineering known as LCE and later to the University of Pune. From then on, the college has gone on expanding adding new departments and new wings by the year.</p>

        <p class="h5 my-para">College of Engineering Pune (COEP), abbreviated as COEP is an autonomous engineering institute affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Established in 1854, it is one of the oldest engineering colleges in Asia, after College of Engineering, Guindy Chennai (1794) and IIT Roorkee (1847). It's the top institute in engineering, with admission 
            offered based on state CET exam. The students and alumni of College of Engineering, Pune are colloquially referred to as COEPians. 
            Undergraduate admissions to the College of Engineering, Pune are competitive and are based on merit.

        <p class="h2 text-center">ACTIVITIES</p>
        <p class="h5 my-para">COEP is the hub of various curricular, extra-curricular and technical activities which attracts participation and praise alike from numerous colleges in India.
            COEPâ€™s Annual National-Level Sports Festival, called ZEST. ZEST is the sports extravaganza that everyone prepares for, that everyone waits for, and that everyone aims for. 
            ZEST is the platform for all the amateur sportspeople, and is also a battlefield for all the experienced veterans, having tons of experience and skill in their game. For the past 16 years, ZEST has always been on the rise, witnessing stellar action and competition from participants across all over the country. 
            On top of that, students of COEP also participate in ZEST and win laurels for their college. To put it short, ZEST is THE place to be, and the sporting avenue to explore! 
            MindSpark is the national level annual technical festival hosted by the college and established in 2007. The idea behind MindSpark originated from the need to unite various departmental 
            level festivals that were scattered across the academic calendar. It features about 50 events across various disciplines of engineering and has been backed by the support of industrial sponsors who also associate with COEP for placement. 
            This event is usually scheduled in an odd semester (around September) and is of 3 days(usually weekend).</p>
